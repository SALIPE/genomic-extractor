# Genomic Region Extraction using k-mers

## Overview

A novel computational methodology for discriminative region extraction.This data-driven, non-parametric approach employs exclusive k-mers through strategically defined sliding windows to identify genomic regions with high concentrations of variant-specific signatures.
